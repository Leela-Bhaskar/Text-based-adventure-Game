## üìú About The Project

This project is a self-contained, text-based adventure game that runs in any standard Python environment. The player navigates through a series of interconnected locations by typing simple commands. The story unfolds based on the player's choices, featuring a simple inventory system and multiple outcomes.

The entire game logic and content are stored within a single, easy-to-read Python file, making it a great example of fundamental game loop design and state management.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Storytelling:** Your decisions directly influence the path you take and the story's conclusion.
* **Atmospheric Text Display:** Dialogue and descriptions are printed with a "slow type" effect to build suspense and immersion.
* **Simple Command Interface:** Interact with the world using intuitive commands like `go north`, `examine tree`, or `use key`.
* **Inventory System:** Find and carry items that are essential for solving puzzles and accessing new areas.
* **Branching Narrative:** Explore different locations, from a dark cave to a mysterious cabin, with multiple endings.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Runs with standard Python 3 libraries, requiring no external packages or complicated setup.

    Or simply download the `text_based_adventure_game.py` file.

2.  **Navigate to the game directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and move into the project folder.
    ```sh
    cd your_repository_name
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    Execute the Python script to begin your adventure.
    ```sh
    python "text based adventure game.py"
    ```

4.  **Enjoy!**
    Follow the on-screen prompts and type your choices to navigate the world.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It's Made

The game's engine is surprisingly simple and is built around a few key components in the `text_based_adventure_game.py` file:

* **`game_map` Dictionary:** This is the heart of the game. It's a Python dictionary that holds all the locations, their descriptions, the items they contain, and the choices that link them together. This data-driven structure makes it incredibly easy to expand the world.

    ```python
    game_map = {
        'start': {
            'description': "You awaken in a dimly lit, ancient forest...",
            'choices': {
                'go north': 'path',
                'go east': 'river',
            }
        },
        # ... more locations
    }
    ```

* **Main Game Loop:** The `play_game()` function contains a `while` loop that:
    1.  Prints the description of the current location.
    2.  Checks for win/loss conditions.
    3.  Handles item pickups.
    4.  Presents the player with valid choices.
    5.  Updates the player's location based on their input.

* **Helper Functions:**
    * `print_slow()`: Prints text character-by-character to create a paced, narrative feel.
    * `get_choice()`: Prompts the player for input and ensures it's a valid choice for the current scene.

## üé® Customization

Want to create your own story? It's easy! Just modify the `game_map` dictionary.

1.  **Add a New Room:** Create a new entry in the dictionary with a unique name (e.g., `'haunted_ruins'`).
2.  **Write a Description:** Add a `'description'` key with the text you want players to see.
3.  **Create Connections:** Add a `'choices'` dictionary that links to other locations (e.g., `'go west': 'clearing'`).
4.  **Link to It:** Update another room's `choices` to lead to your new location.
